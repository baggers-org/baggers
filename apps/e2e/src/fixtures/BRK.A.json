The firm's core business segment is insurance, run primarily through Geico, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group. Berkshire has used the excess cash thrown off from these and its other operations over the years to acquire Burlington Northern Santa Fe (railroad), Berkshire Hathaway Energy (utilities and energy distributors), and the firms that make up its manufacturing, service, and retailing operations (which include five of Berkshire's largest noninsurance pretax earnings generators: Precision Castparts, Lubrizol, Clayton Homes, Marmon, and IMC/ISCAR). The conglomerate is unique in that it is run on a completely decentralized basis.","homepageUrl":"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com","iconUrl":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/d3d3LmJlcmtzaGlyZWhhdGhhd2F5LmNvbQ/images/2022-10-01_icon.png","logoUrl":"https://api.polygon.io/v1/reference/company-branding/d3d3LmJlcmtzaGlyZWhhdGhhd2F5LmNvbQ/images/2022-10-01_logo.svg","listDate":"1980-03-17","market":"stocks","marketCap":656491349301.6599,"name":"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.","sicCode":"6331","sicDescription":"FIRE, MARINE & CASUALTY INSURANCE","totalEmployees":372000,"type":"CS","weightedSharesOutstanding":1467342}}
