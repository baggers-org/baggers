### Graphql Deploy

# Unfortunately serverless does not allow you to dynamically set plugins,
# when we got to deploy our production node_modules we get "Serverless-offline" not found
# For now i will probably just include this as a production dependency (ew)
# But in future i can remove this dependency by hacking the serverless yml
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48460763/disable-sls-plugin-on-production-different-plugins-per-stage
# serverless github actions will help to deploy after we get this working locally


## TODO: 1st September

# Graphql And UI builds working
# This script needs to be broken down into .github/workflow commands etc.
