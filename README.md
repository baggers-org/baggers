# Baggers
This project consumed many many years of my life - and it opened many doors for me. It was maybe a solution in search of a problem - but I loved working on it. 

## Why is this public?
I consider this project to be some of my best work, and its a shame that it is just sitting in a private Github repo gathering dust. I get a lot of DM's asking for examples of X and Y and I always end up sending snippets from this repo. So better to just make it public for ease of sharing.

## What is Baggers?
Baggers was my attempt at creating [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for the stock market (at least thats how I sell it to other devs). But it was really my amateur attempt at creating a bloomberg terminal for the web. The vision was to have a rich data driven UI that allowed users to create custom visualisations of the stock market, as well as track and monitor their portfolios. I ran out of steam towards the end purely because I couldn't find a market fit for it, I think the vision i had was something that I (an amateur investor) wanted, but in reality the pro's already have solutions they are very satisfied with.

I think its sad at the end of the day that something that I worked on purely for fun was usurped by my desire to monetize it. 

At the end of the day, I learnt a lot from this project - technically speaking and from a motivational sense. I think the headline for me is "if you plan to monetize something, make sure you understand your user and problem space first, otherwise do it for fun and make it open source"
